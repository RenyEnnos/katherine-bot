"""Desktop entrypoint: opens the Katherine window via pywebview (#334).

Responsibilities (deliberately tiny):

1. resolve the local frontend build (explicit failure if missing);
2. build the sanitized, allowlisted desktop bridge (``make_js_api``);
3. open one pywebview window pointed at the local build via ``file://``;
4. enforce the navigation policy below;
5. block until the window closes, then return cleanly.

Not here (on purpose): no domain logic, no ConversationEngine, no
backend server, no HTTP hosting of the UI, no background services.

Lifecycle notes:
* No threads, sockets, servers, or ports are created by this shell.
* Shutdown is the window close: ``webview.start()`` returns and the
  process exits normally through the caller. No ``os._exit``, no kills.

Navigation policy (remote content must never gain the privileged bridge)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

pywebview injects ``window.pywebview`` into *whatever document the
webview loaded last* (WebKitGTK re-injects on every ``load-changed`` /
FINISHED). Loading ``file://`` initially is therefore not enough: a
same-window ``location`` change (link click, ``window.location = ...``)
would hand ``window.pywebview.api`` to remote content.

This module enforces two independent, local layers:

1. **Revert navigation** — a ``loaded`` event handler checks the window
   URL; if it is no longer the local build, it *revokes the trust
   first* (:meth:`BuildTrust.revoke`) and then navigates back to the
   entry. The remote document may exist transiently, but cannot be
   interacted with and does not persist.
2. **Fail-closed bridge** — the ``js_api`` object checks the URL on
   *every* call. A call is served only when the current URL is exactly
   the URL of the last *completed and committed* local load. Any
   in-flight navigation — remote, or the revert itself, even when
   ``get_uri()`` already shows the local entry URL again — leaves the
   bridge closed. Even in the race window before the revert completes,
   remote code cannot invoke Python through the bridge.

Both layers are simple and local (no proxy, no HTTP server, no extra
process) and covered by ``backend/tests/test_desktop_navigation.py``
plus the reproducible smoke in ``scripts/desktop_smoke.py``.

Why the trust must be *revoked* before the revert navigation
(reviewer follow-up on the same-URL window): WebKitGTK's ``get_uri()``
reflects the load that *started*. When the revert navigates back to
the very same ``entry_html`` the window opened with, ``get_uri()``
returns the previously committed URL while the **remote document is
still the live document**. URL equality therefore proves neither
document identity nor load completion; the only thing that may
re-open the bridge is the ``loaded`` event of the *new* local load
committing again.

    Why this exists (race found during validation): WebKitGTK's
    ``get_uri()`` reflects the most recent load that *started*, not the
    document that is actually alive. During the revert navigation
    (remote → local) there is a window where ``get_uri()`` is already
    the local ``file://`` URL while the **remote document is still
    alive** and could invoke the bridge. A URL check alone would pass
    in that window.

    The trust model closes it: only a URL whose load *completed* as a
    local build page (committed by the ``loaded`` handler, which also
    reverts non-local pages) may serve bridge calls, and the current
    URL must still equal that committed URL.

    **The same-URL window** (reviewer follow-up): the revert navigates
    back to the very ``entry_html`` the window opened with. Because
    ``get_uri()`` flips as soon as that load starts, ``current_url ==
    committed`` is TRUE again while the remote document is still the
    live document. URL equality proves neither identity nor

    a non-local load is reported — BEFORE the revert navigation is
    issued — and only the ``loaded`` event of the new local load
    (a fresh commit) may re-open the bridge. There is no state in
    which an in-flight navigation (remote or revert) serves a call.
