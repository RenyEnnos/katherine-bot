"""Navigation policy tests for the desktop shell (#334, review B2).

Loading ``file://`` initially is not enough to keep the privileged
bridge away from remote content: pywebview injects
``window.pywebview`` into whatever document loaded last, and a
same-window navigation (link click, ``window.location = ...``) would
hand the bridge to a remote page.

Contract under test (the two local policy layers in
``backend/desktop/app.py``):

1. ``is_local_build_url`` — the structural predicate deciding which
   URLs count as "the local build" (exact index, inside dist, no
   traversal, no query/fragment, file scheme with empty host);
2. ``LocalBuildBridge`` — the ``js_api`` object fails closed: when the
   window is not showing the local build, calls return a sanitized
   ``bridge_unavailable`` payload instead of executing;
3. the ``loaded`` handler wiring — ``run_desktop_shell`` registers a
   handler that reverts navigation away from the build (verified with a
   stubbed ``webview`` module: no window is ever created here).

All tests are headless: no pywebview window is created.
